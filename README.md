A NLP exercise based on the Large Movie Review Dataset from Andrew Maas.

1. "sentiment_analysis.ipynb" contains NLP processing for the labelled corpus data. Logistic Regression and Linear Support Vector Classification models are then trained to predict the sentiment of movie reviews.

2. "labelling_reviews".ipynb" frist tries to predict the sentiment of the unlabelled reviews in Large Movie Review dataset with test2emotion package, an online available package. Then the results are compared with the predictions from trained logistic regression model in "sentiment_analysis.ipynb".
